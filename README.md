The Nigma App is a puzzle game created with Jetpack compose and bootsted with AppWrite.

## App overview

* You can register a new account by typing in a username, email, and password. The user is saved in the User feature of AppWrite.
* You can log in with your email and password. AppWrite provides the login mechanism.
* The list of puzzles is shown by fetching from the AppWrite database and is watching for changes in real-time.
* You can create a new puzzle by writing a name and description and selecting an image from your storage. Then the database is updated and the image is uploaded to the AppWrite storage feature.
* When you complete a puzzle the database update the corresponding document by adding the userId. When the userId is set, the Realtime feature sends a callback that a puzzle document changes, and then, the list is updated removing the puzzles resolved by the authenticated user.
* Puzzles resolved by the user are shown in the profile section.
* The profile section allows you to: change the username, change the image profile, and log out.
